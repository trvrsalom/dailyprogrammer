From the [/r/dailyprogrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) wiki:
>Dailyprogrammer is about challenging programmers of all skill level with weekly programming challenges. 3 challenges a week are posted at increasing difficulty. Solutions are peer reviewed and redditors can ask for the community for feedback and comments.

I may also include some prompts/challenges from other places, and will hopefully learn a lot through this process.
