# dailyprogrammer

####What?
Basically, I want to practice programming everyday in a meaningful way. 
My goal is to work on various challenges from [/r/dailyprogrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) while changing languages every week.

From the [/r/dailyprogrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) wiki:
>Dailyprogrammer is about challenging programmers of all skill level with weekly programming challenges. 3 challenges a week are posted at increasing difficulty. Solutions are peer reviewed and redditors can ask for the community for feedback and comments.

*I may also include some prompts/challenges from other places!*

####Why?
I hope this exercise will allow me to become a better program and learn a lot through daily practice

[I will record my progress here.](log.md)
